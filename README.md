# âš¡Real-Time Classification of Metal & Non-Metal Objects Using Deep Learning  

## ðŸ“ŒOverview  

In this project, we developed a real-time system that detects and classifies metal and non-metal objects using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The goal is to aid in waste segregation and recycling by accurately identifying materials and categorizing them into different types.  

We use two models:  

- **YOLOv8 (Object Detection Model):** Detects objects placed on a surface.  
- **Custom CNN Model (Classification Model):** Classifies detected objects into six categories: Steel, Copper, Rusted, Iron, Aluminum, and Non-Metal.  

This system provides a color-based classification output in real-time, making it efficient for automated sorting.


## ðŸ“Š Results & Accuracy

**YOLOv8 Model:** 96% accuracy in detecting objects on a surface.

**CNN Model:** 79% accuracy in classifying metals and non-metals.

**Color-based visualization** for classified objects in real-time.
